## 2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.
* B stands for Behavior: This is the action or habit you want to establish or change.
* M stands for Motivation: This is your desire or willingness to perform the behavior.
* P stands for Prompt: This is the trigger that initiates the behavior, reminding you to act.
  
   To use this formula to make new habits easier:
 * Start with the tiniest version of a habit to require minimal motivation. Find a behavior that takes 30 seconds or less to complete.
 * Use action prompts, where one behavior triggers the next, to build momentum for your tiny habits.
 * Nurture your tiny habit with "shine," which is the feeling of accomplishment, to help it grow into a more significant habit.
 * Celebrate even tiny wins to boost your confidence and motivation, making habit development easier.

## 3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)
* Each time you celebrate, you remind yourself that you can do it. Even if the habit is tiny, each success helps build your confidence, which keeps you motivated to continue.
* When you celebrate, even if it’s just a small victory, your brain releases positive feelings. This makes you associate the habit with something good, which makes you want to do it again.
* The celebration itself becomes a form of motivation.

## 7. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?
*  Make the bad habit less convenient. For example, if you want to stop watching TV, unplug it after each use or hide the remote. The extra effort makes you think twice before doing it.
*  Set up your surroundings to discourage the habit. If you’re trying to eat healthier, keep junk food out of the house or at least out of sight.
*  Create barriers that make the habit harder to engage in. For instance, use apps to block distracting websites or give someone else the password to an app you want to avoid.
*   Tell a friend or family member about your goal to quit the habit. You can even set consequences, like paying them money if you slip up. It’s amazing how knowing someone’s watching can keep you in check!
