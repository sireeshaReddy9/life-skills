## 3. What are the obstacles in your listening process?
* distractions are a big one. If there's a lot of noise around me, or if I’m distracted by my own thoughts, it’s tough to really focus on what someone’s saying.
* prejudging the situation. Sometimes, if I already have an idea of what the speaker’s going to say or if I have a bias about the topic, it can block me from truly listening and being open to their point of view.
*  I'm not interested in the topic, it’s easy to zone out. If it doesn’t grab my attention, my mind starts wandering, and I struggle to stay engaged.
*  I can’t ignore body language. If the speaker seems closed off or avoids eye contact, it’s hard for me to stay fully engaged. It’s like I pick up on those signals and it affects how connected I feel to the conversation.

## 4. What can you do to improve your listening?
* I try to eliminate distractions first. That means finding a quiet spot where I can focus and putting my phone away so I’m not checking notifications or getting distracted by other things. It helps me stay fully present in the conversation.
* I remind myself to set aside any biases and really listen to the other person’s point of view.
* I make an effort to be patient and let the speaker finish their thoughts before I jump in.
