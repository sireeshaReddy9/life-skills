# Learning Process
## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique
* Feynman Technique is a learning method that involves teaching a concept in simple terms to improve in understanding and enhance comprehension.
## 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
* Barbara Oakley's TED talk is packed with fascinating ideas, but one that stands out is the concept of "chunking." Chunking involves breaking down information into manageable chunks or pieces, which makes it easier to understand and remember.
## 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
* Focused Mode:
    This is the state when you are actively concentrating on a specific task or problem. In this mode, you are using direct, deliberate mental effort to try to understand or solve something. For example, when you're studying a concept, doing a math problem, or working on a project that requires attention and precision.
* Diffuse Mode:
    This is the relaxed, unfocused state of thinking, where youâ€™re not consciously working on a specific problem. It happens when you are daydreaming, walking, exercising, or even when you're taking a break from focused work. During this time, your brain is still processing information but in a more indirect and creative way.
  ## 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.
  * Set a target performance level.
  * Deconstruct the skill into smaller subskills.
  * Research just enough to practice effectively.
  * Remove barriers to practice.
  * Pre-commit to 20 hours of practice.
  ## 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?
  * Break concepts down into simpler parts.
  * Practice consistently and apply concepts in projects.
  * Explain the concept in your own words.
  * Teach others or discuss with peers.
  * Use active learning techniques like the Feynman Method or mind mapping.
  * Set achievable goals with flexible deadlines.
  * Reflect on your learning and adjust strategies.
  * Make the learning process enjoyable and relevant to your interests.
  * Embrace mistakes and learn from them.
  * Regularly self-evaluate and track progress.
